# Technical Specification B2B MAICO Sessions – Integration Interface


## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 General
MAICO Sessions is designed and manufactured to meet all quality and safety requirements.
When designing MAICO Sessions MAICO placed particular importance on making it a user-
friendly software. The intent was to make its operation easy-to-learn, thus making the
software simple and easy to operate.
This document describes the GDT (Gerätedatentransfer) and XML (Extensible Markup
Language) integration interfaces implemented for MAICO Sessions version 1.1.0 and newer.
Both interfaces are part of standalone version of MAICO Sessions and no extra tool needs to
be installed. All measurements and devices which are supported by MAICO Sessions are
working via the integrated integration interface.

## 2 Integration
Sessions, in standalone mode, can be integrated without an additional database via the
file based data interfaces to an existing EMR/EMR database. Sessions can be integrated
via GDT or XML.
### 2.1 Connection via XML or GDT Interface (Standalone Version)

software has been successfully established, the data exchange is updated each time
MAICO Sessions is started or ended.

in the Start menu or entering Sessions via the Windows® search function.
